# codegeneratorjavaparser

This is source code for a computer science education research @ Enhanced Learning and Instructional Techonologies at Emory.

The research's goal was to evaluate the influence of code-tracing practices on novice programmersâ€™ programming skills. Specifically,  a back-tracing algorithm was designed based on JavaParser to randomly generate blocks of Java code. 

Code-Generator software was based on the algorithm and was delevoped in JAVAFX. The software could automatically generate tracing problems with different complexities and give automatic feedbacks to each problem. Code-Generator could also evaluate a problem in sub-steps and assign problems specifically designed for each user by learning from his or her past learning behaviors.
